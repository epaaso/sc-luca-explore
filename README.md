# Exploring of the scLUCA dataset

For building coabundance networks.

We are basing ourselves on the wonderful work by [Salcher, Sturm, Horvath et al. 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36368318/)

The workflow for getting from the raw AnnData files to the the coabundance graphs is this one:

## Troubleshooting

Due to the long training and annealing times, jlab sometimes cannot connect.
Use this to get a console to the kernel:
`ipython console --existing /root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/kernel-50c440a3-554d-4d98-bb90-bdda9a8923d5.json`

This could be easier in a newer version of jlab. To locate the corresponding json
you can use htop with option to not display user branches and seeing the memory it
is using.

In this image: python:3.11.4. It is important
to install the docker nvidia package to 
transfer your cuda installation to the
containers.

We are using an image generated by the Dockerfile in this repo.
